#The goal of this program is to apply connected component analysis and feature extraction on images using algorithms like Raw-by-Raw labeling algorithm.
#It will report on all objects found in a gray-level input image. 
#The program performs thresholding and cleaning using morphological filters (for morphological filters external library were used).
#calculating features like: circularity 1, circularity 2, second moment row/col/mixed and the perimeter we used N8 neighbouring and N4 for the perimeter length. 
#Check results.pgm to see the output of this program.  
#Outside code use: numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries. As well, for morphological filtering, used the scikit image library.
